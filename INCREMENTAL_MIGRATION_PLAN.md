# Incremental Migration Plan: Python + Supabase → Convex Backend

## 🎯 **Migration Philosophy: Feature-by-Feature**

**Strategy**: Migrate high-impact features first, run systems in parallel, validate incrementally
**Benefits**: Lower risk, earlier UX improvements, easier rollback, continuous validation
**Timeline**: 8 weeks (vs 7 weeks big-bang, but much safer)

---

## 🚀 **Phase 1: Real-time Infrastructure (Week 1-2)**
*Priority: 🔴 Critical | UX Impact: 🟢 Highest | Risk: 🟡 Medium*

- Whiteboard real-time sync
- Tutor WebSocket endpoints  
- Message routing and authentication

❌ Keep in Python (for now):

- Session management
- File processing
- Background jobs
```

### **Tasks:**
- [x] **1.1 WebSocket Foundation** (Days 1-3)
  - [x] Set up `convex/wsServer.ts` with connection management
  - [x] Implement JWT authentication for WebSocket connections
  - [x] Create message routing and validation framework
  - [x] Add connection cleanup and error handling
